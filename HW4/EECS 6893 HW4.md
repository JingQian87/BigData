###### 1. Answer these questions in simple words.

**1.1 ** 

SVG Coordinate Space and Mathematical/Graph Coordinate are both 2-dimensional flat space. They work in the same way except following:

* The (0, 0) coordinates of Mathematical Coordinate Space fall on the bottom left while those of SVG Coordinate Space on the top left.

* The Mathematical Coordinate Space has Y coordinate growing from bottom to top while SVG Coordinate Space has Y coordinate growing from top to bottom. 

  

**1.2**

In d3.js, enter() and exit() are operations that used in joining an array of data to a D3 selection. If the array is longer than the selection, we use enter() to represent the missing elements. If the array is shorter than the selection, we use exit() to represent elements that need to be removed.
